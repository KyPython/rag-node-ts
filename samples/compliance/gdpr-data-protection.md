## Key Principles

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. Organizations must inform individuals about how their data is collected and used.

### 2. Purpose Limitation

## Rights of Data Subjects

### Right to Access
Individuals have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether their personal data is being processed and access to that data.

### Right to Rectification
Individuals can request correction of inaccurate personal data or completion of incomplete data.

### Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")
Individuals can request deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances, such as when data is no longer necessary for the original purpose.

### Right to Restrict Processing
